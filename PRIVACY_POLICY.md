# Privacy Policy

Auto Page Scroller does not collect, store, process, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data.

The extension operates entirely on the user’s local device and only performs auto-scrolling actions on the currently active webpage when explicitly triggered by the user.

No user data is collected, logged, stored, shared, or sold to any third party.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact the developer.
